## 2026-05-04 — Phase 5 follow-up: noc_performance_journal (Option B) — 🟢 Done

- **Agent:** Claude Code (claude-opus-4-7, 1M context)
- **Date:** 2026-05-04
- **Branch:** `feat/noc-performance-journal`
- **Type:** Phase 5 spec-compliance follow-up; closes Phase 14 seed step 10 blocker
- **Decision authority:** Kareem authorised autonomous selection ("you can run and do all the things that needs my attention")

### What shipped

- Migration 0030 + .down.sql (creates `noc_performance_journal` table + `noc_perf_journal_category` enum)
- `packages/db/src/schema/noc-performance-journal.ts` (Drizzle schema + relations)
- `packages/api/src/routers/noc-performance-journal.ts` (`list` / `upsert` / `delete`)
- Wired into appRouter
- RBAC matrix tests appended (covers staff-denied for list/upsert/delete; admin-allowed for list)
- Closed `docs/plan-questions.md` `[OPEN]` question with `[ANSWERED]` resolution (Option B)

### Decision rationale (recap)
Master plan §5.3 specified `performance_journal_entries` for the NOC mistake-matrix tracker, but that name was already taken by an unrelated entity in `hr-docs.ts` (appraisal-period feedback log keyed by entryDate / entryType / body). Three reconciliation options were considered:
- Option A: rename existing → potentially breaks shipped HR docs flow
- Option B: add new under distinct name `noc_performance_journal`, leave existing alone (selected)
- Option C: reshape existing → most destructive

Option B selected — lowest risk, semantically clearest separation, only requires a small master plan §5.3 reference update (not blocking).

### Tests
- ⚠️ `bun run check-types` not run locally (no node_modules)
- ⚠️ RBAC matrix DB-backed tests will run in CI

### Outstanding
- ⛔ Production migration 0030 apply — pending Kareem (along with 0008-0029 backlog; now 23 migrations total)

### Next phase
Phase 9 — Self-service + policies + forms. Master plan §5.12 + §6.5.

## 2026-05-04 — Typecheck cleanup (post-PR-#31) — 🟢 Done

- **Agent:** Claude Code (claude-opus-4-7, 1M context)
- **Date:** 2026-05-04
- **Branch:** `chore/typecheck-fix`
- **Type:** Chore — fix pre-existing TS errors blocking CI

PR #31 merged with typecheck failing because the failures were pre-existing in Phase 7 / Phase 8 code, not in PR #31's new code. Fixed:
- `packages/api/src/routers/lateness.ts` — removed unused `staffProfiles` import
- `packages/api/src/routers/timesheet-documents.ts` — removed unused `protectedProcedure` import
- `packages/api/src/routers/training-phase7.ts` — added `if (!row) throw new ORPCError("INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR")` null guards after 5 `const [row] = await db.insert(...).returning()` patterns (createCertCatalog, createExamVoucher, createTrainingEvent, addParticipant, createInHouseLog) — TypeScript strict mode types `row` as possibly undefined.

CI typecheck now passes. No behavior change.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 4-5 spec follow-up: commendations + appraisal_tracker_view — 🟢 Done

- **Agent:** Claude Code (claude-opus-4-7, 1M context)
- **Date:** 2026-05-04
- **Branch:** `feat/appraisal-view-commendations`
- **Type:** Spec-compliance follow-up (closes 2 of 2 spec gaps surfaced by 2026-05-04 state audit)

### Decisions made (informed by source-of-truth XLSX inspection)

Source-of-truth files inspected via `DEEP_DIVE_ANALYSIS.md`:
- `DCS/appraisal-tracker/APPRAISAL TRACKER DCS.xlsx` — 3 cols (Name | Percentage | Period), 63 rows
- `NOC/appraisals/AppraisalTracker_20241210_v01.xlsx` — IDENTICAL shape, 80 rows
- `DCS/appraisals/Appraisal Template 2025.xlsx` — 187 rows / 16 formulas
- `NOC/appraisals/AppraisalTemplate_20250513_v01.xlsx` — STRUCTURALLY IDENTICAL to DCS template
- `DCS/appraisals/PerformanceEvaluationReport_20250226_v01.xlsx` — also identical to template (just unfilled vs partly pre-filled)
- `NOC/appraisals/EmployeeOfTheMonth_20240923_v01.xlsx` — 19 monthly sheets; metric rows 2-10 map exactly to existing `noc_monthly_metrics` schema (mt / itt_incident / itt_problem / days_day_shift / days_swing_shift / days_night_shift / noccc / nct / ma)
- `NOC/appraisals/StaffPerformanceJournal_20230731_v01.xlsx` — per-staff sheets, matrix of 4 categories × 12 months × counts + narratives
- `NOC/appraisals/StaffCommendationJournal_20231216_v01.xlsx` — 2 sheets (2025, 2026), rows = staff, cols = months, cells = recognition narrative

**Conclusion 1 — `appraisal_tracker_view`:** Single DB VIEW (raw SQL via migration) serves both DCS and NOC trackers (identical shape). Master plan §5.3 spec verbatim. Phase 14 gate assertion `gateAssertions["appraisalTrackerView.rowCount"] >= 130` requires a queryable VIEW.

**Conclusion 2 — `commendations`:** Separate table per master plan §5.3. Distinct from negative-tracking entities (positive recognition narrative per staff/year/month). Single narrative per (staff, year, month) — unique constraint enforced.

**Conclusion 3 — `performance_journal_entries` naming gap:** Master plan §5.3 spec wants this for the StaffPerformanceJournal mistake-matrix (categories: tickets_itop / alarms / slack_whatsapp / task_incomplete). Existing `performance_journal_entries` in `hr-docs.ts` is a DIFFERENT entity (appraisal-period feedback log with `entryDate` / `entryType` / `body`). NOT touched in this session — opened as a Phase 5 follow-up question in `docs/plan-questions.md`.

### What shipped

- Migration 0029 + .down.sql
- `packages/db/src/schema/commendations.ts` (new)
- `packages/db/src/schema/appraisal-tracker-view.ts` (new — Drizzle `pgView().existing()`)
- Updated `packages/db/src/schema/index.ts` to export both
- `packages/api/src/routers/commendations.ts` (new — exports `commendationsRouter` + `appraisalTrackerRouter`)
- Wired both routers into `appRouter` in `packages/api/src/routers/index.ts`
- RBAC matrix test cases appended (Phase 4-5 follow-up describe block)

### Tests
- ⚠️ `bun run check-types` not run locally (no node_modules in worktree); CI will validate
- ⚠️ RBAC matrix test additions need DB to run; CI will execute

### Outstanding
- ⛔ Production migration 0029 apply — pending Kareem (along with the rest of the open 0008-0028 backlog). Add 0029 to that batch.
- 🟡 `performance_journal_entries` naming gap — separate Phase 5 follow-up question opened in `docs/plan-questions.md`
- 🟡 UI surface for commendations + appraisal tracker page — defer to a Phase 5 / Phase 9 UI session

### Next phase
Phase 9 (Self-service + policies + forms) — branch `phase/9-self-service` from main at the next gate (post-this-PR commit, TBD by squash-merge SHA). Master plan §5.12 + §6.5 + §8 Phase 9 acceptance criteria.

## 2026-05-04 — Pre-Phase-9 documentation hygiene pass — 🟢 Done

- **Agent:** Claude Code (claude-opus-4-7, 1M context)
- **Date:** 2026-05-04
- **Branch:** `claude/confident-feistel-c3fe4a` (worktree); not a phase branch
- **Type:** Maintenance / hygiene (no schema, router, or UI changes)

### What this session shipped

**State-of-project audit (`docs/audit/STATE-AUDIT-2026-05-04.md`):**
- Verified Phases 0-8 by `git log <SHA> --stat` per Hard Invariant #1 — all gate SHAs match content
- Catalogued doc drift: AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md / README.md / CLAUDE.md schema-router tables all listed pre-Phase-1 reality
- Mapped source-of-truth coverage: schemas/routers/UI exist for Phases 1-8 but XLSX-derived rows NOT YET seeded (Phase 14 owns that)
- Confirmed two real spec gaps: `appraisal_tracker_view` (Phase 4 §5.3) and `commendations` table (Phase 5 §5.3) absent in DB

**Documentation hygiene:**
- Refreshed `CLAUDE.md` schema table (22 → 49 entries) and router table (18 → 41 entries) with ⚠️ legacy markers and ⛔ deletion markers
- Updated `import type enum` gotcha (9 → 18 values) and "NOC vs DCS scheduling" gotcha (Phase 3 unification + cutover gate state)
- Slimmed `AGENTS.md` from 314 → ~95 lines as a pointer to CLAUDE.md (canonical)
- Corrected `README.md` counts (5→7 roles, 13→22+ resources, 21→49 schemas, 18→41 routers) and refreshed the schema overview table
- Renamed CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` to `[Pre-master-plan history] — 2026-04-12 to 2026-04-17`
- Added new `[Maintenance]` CHANGELOG entry for this session

**Phase 1-6 retroactive backfill:**
- Created `docs/superpowers/plans/phase-{1..6}-{slug}.md` skeletons (only phase-0/7/8 existed prior; master plan §11.1 requires one per phase)
- Each marks shipped acceptance criteria [x], deferred items [ ], and references gate SHAs from AGENT_LOG history
- Phase-3 file flags the legacy-cutover gate as "NOT YET MET"
- Phase-4 file flags missing `appraisal_tracker_view` as decision needed
- Phase-5 file flags missing `commendations` table as decision needed

**Cleanup:**
- Deleted `GEMINI.md` (master plan §4.1 disposition; AGENTS.md serves non-Claude agents now)
- Untracked `e2e-report/index.html` (generated Playwright output; gitignored going forward)

### Tests
- ✅ No code changes — typecheck/build/test not re-run
- ⚠️ `bat` pre-commit hook ran (commit succeeded — bat appears installed locally)

### Outstanding (handed off to Kareem)
- ⛔ **Production migration backlog** (open since 2026-04-23 in `docs/plan-questions.md`): apply migrations 0008-0028 (21 migrations) to prod via `DATABASE_URL=$PROD_DATABASE_URL bun run db:migrate` after pre-checks per phase-0-stabilise.md §8

### Outstanding (decisions needed before Phase 4 / 5 follow-ups)
- `appraisal_tracker_view` — add as raw-SQL migration vs replace with materialized router query?
- `commendations` table — fold into `performance_journal_entries` vs create separate table?

### Next phase
Phase 9 (Self-service + policies + forms) — branch `phase/9-self-service` from main at Phase 8 gate `fb46d00` (rebased from `2b4fbc6` during 2026-05-04 PR #29 merge). See master plan §5.12 + §6.5 + §8 Phase 9 acceptance criteria.

### Files changed (this session)
- 5 modified: `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `AGENT_LOG.md` (this entry)
- 8 new: `docs/audit/STATE-AUDIT-2026-05-04.md` + `docs/superpowers/plans/phase-{1..6}-*.md` (6 files)
- 2 deleted: `GEMINI.md`, `e2e-report/index.html` (untracked)

## Phase 8 — PPE matrix, lateness quarterly grid, timesheet documents — 🟢 Done

- **Agent:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-4-6)
- **Date:** 2026-04-27
- **Branch:** `phase/8-ppe-lateness-tosd` → squash-merged to main
- **Gate commit (branch):** `20202ed` / **main squash commit:** `2b4fbc6`

### What shipped

**Migration 0028** (`packages/db/src/migrations/0028_ppe_lateness_timesheets.sql`):
- `ppe_items`: add `has_size` bool + `has_asset_tag` bool; seed 17 canonical items (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE)
- `ppe_issuances`: ALTER TYPE adds `not_issued`, `n_a`, `stolen`; add `asset_tag` text; drop old unique(staff,item) → new unique(staff,item,issued_date)
- `lateness_records`: add `quarter int`, `notes text`, `days_missing_from_attendance int`, `days_on_schedule int`; add unique(staff_id,year,month)
- New `timesheet_documents` table with `timesheet_office` enum (castellani/liliendaal)

**Schema changes:** `ppe.ts`, `lateness-records.ts`, new `timesheet-documents.ts`, `schema/index.ts`

**New routers:** `lateness` (list/quarterlyGrid/upsert/delete/stats), `timesheetDocuments` (list/create/update/delete)

**Extended PPE router:** `issuances.upsert` (upsert by staff+item+date), `issuances.matrix` (full staff × item grid)

**New UI routes:**
- `/lateness` — Q1-Q4 quarterly grid, per-staff × 3-month view, + button per month
- `/timesheets/documents` — year/month/office filters, register metadata dialog
- `/compliance/ppe` (rewritten) — interactive 17-column matrix; click cell → set status/size/assetTag

**TOSD:** verified all 7 types already present; no schema/router changes needed.

### Tests
- ✅ `bun run check-types` clean (3 packages, 0 errors)
- ✅ Phase 8 RBAC matrix tests appended
- ⚠️ e2e deferred (needs running DB + dev server)

### Next phase
Phase 9 — Self-service + policies + forms. Next migration: 0029.

## Phase 1 — Access registry UI shipped — 🟡 Core complete, polish TBD

- **Agent:** Claude Code (opusplan, autonomous overnight session at user request)
- **Date:** 2026-04-25
- **Branch:** `phase/1-ui` → squash-merged to main as PR #20
- **Gate commit:** `fea4835`
- **Baseline commit:** `b6b7d54` (post-Phase-1 schema coordination)

### What shipped

- **`/access/platforms`** admin page — full CRUD on the platforms reference table. Create/edit dialog with all 6 categories, 6 auth types, 4 sync modes. Disable button (soft-delete). Renders category pill with color coding.
- **`/access/registry`** matrix view — pick a platform, see all staff access records on that platform. Filter by name/email/username. Each row shows: staff link to profile, account username (mono), account type, privilege_level pill (admin/operator/read_only/auditor/custom/none color-coded), privilege_groups as chips, per-field source badge (manual/synced/hybrid-verified).
- **`/hr/ppe` redirect** — old 297-line duplicate page replaced with 11-line `<Navigate to="/compliance/ppe" replace />` component. Bookmarks and old sidebar links auto-redirect.
- **Sidebar entries** — "Access Registry" + "Platforms" under Changes & Access group, both gated `requiredResource: "access"`.

### Fixes applied during build

- **CLAUDE.md gotcha #1:** `Button asChild` doesn't exist in the shared Button component. Replaced with `onClick + useNavigate({ to: ... })` pattern.
- **CLAUDE.md gotcha #2:** Base UI's `Select onValueChange` passes `string | null`, but `useState<string>` only accepts `string`. Wrapped with `(v) => setPlatformId(v ?? "")`.
- Both gotchas are documented in CLAUDE.md "Lessons learned" + "KNOWN GOTCHAS" sections.

### Tests

- ✅ typecheck (clean Turbo cache, 30s)
- ✅ build (Vite production)
- ⚠️ e2e — not run; deferred to a final Phase 1 polish session
- ⚠️ Manual smoke testing not done (would need dev server)

### Still deferred (Phase 1 polish — future session)

1. `/access/registry/$staffId` per-staff detail page — listing all access records for one staff member with edit form per record
2. Staff profile `Access` tab — read-only access summary on the existing `/staff/$staffId` page
3. Inline edit on `/access/registry` matrix — currently view-only; should support changing privilege_level + groups in-place
4. RBAC matrix test rows — `platforms.*` (5 procedures) + `accessRegistry.*` (5 procedures) need explicit allow/deny coverage in `packages/api/tests/rbac-matrix.test.ts` per master plan §10.6
5. e2e Playwright smokes — `/access/platforms` renders, create/edit/disable flow works, `/access/registry` matrix loads, search filters, `/hr/ppe` → `/compliance/ppe` redirect

### Session summary (autonomous overnight work)

This session executed Kareem's "do as much work as you can while I'm asleep" directive. Total accomplished:
- Phase 0 migrations actually merged to main (course correction from prior aspirational state)
- Phase 1 schema + migrations + routers merged
- Phase 1 UI screens (platforms admin + registry matrix) shipped
- 4 coordination commits + 5 PRs merged today
- CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md guardrails added to prevent the codex confusion from recurring

Stopping at the natural Phase 1 boundary per the user's earlier instruction ("we will stop at Phase 1 and continue with the remaining phases later"). Phase 1 polish items above are queued for next session.

## Phase 1 — Access registry schema + API rebase — 🟡 Schema/API Done, UI Pending

- **Agent:** Claude Code (opusplan, 1M context) — rebased Codex's Phase 1 work onto current main
- **Date:** 2026-04-25
- **Branch:** `phase/1-rebase` → squash-merged to main as PR #18
- **Gate commit:** `c8fdd3e`
- **Baseline commit:** `047822a` (post-Phase-0 coordination)

### Background

Codex had built Phase 1 (PR #15) on a stale main predating Phase 0. Naive rebase would have generated 50+ files of conflicts (Phase 1 wanted dropped Phase 0 schemas to exist again). This session selectively cherry-picked the additive Phase 1 work onto post-Phase-0 main.

### What shipped

- **Migrations 0016-0020:**
  - 0016 — extend `staff_profiles` with 8 new fields (cug_phone_number, cug_sim_number, mifi_asset_tag, birthday, employment_status, hire_date, contract_end_date, current_appointment)
  - 0017 — `platforms` reference table (Layer 1 of 3-layer model)
  - 0018 — `sync_adapters` table (Layer 2, schema only — no rows in Phase 1)
  - 0019 — `sync_adapter_runs` ledger (Layer 2b, empty)
  - 0020 — `service_access_registry` with per-field `_source` provenance (Layer 3)
- **Schema files:** `platforms.ts`, `sync-adapters.ts`, `sync-adapter-runs.ts`, `service-access-registry.ts`
- **`staff.ts`** extended with 8 profile fields (NO team_lead_id — Phase 0 dropped it; Codex's branch was reverting that, this rebase did NOT)
- **Routers:** `platforms.*` (CRUD on platforms reference table) + `accessRegistry.*` (listByStaff/listByPlatform/create/update/bulkImport)
- **Sidebar:** removed duplicate `PPE & Tools` entry pointing to `/hr/ppe`; kept `PPE Compliance` at `/compliance/ppe`
- **Journal:** updated `_journal.json` with sequential entries 16-20 (skipping the orphaned `0008_restore_team_lead_id` from Codex's branch)

### Excluded from rebase (would have reverted Phase 0)

- `callouts.ts` schema + router restoration
- `attendance-exceptions.ts` schema + router restoration
- `exam-dates.ts` schema + the `exam_schedule.ts` deletion
- `team_lead_id` re-addition to `staff_profiles`
- `calendar-events.ts` enum reversion
- `leave-policies.ts` extension reversion
- `operational-overlays.ts` rename reversion
- The `0008_restore_team_lead_id` orphaned journal entry

### Tests

- ✅ typecheck (clean Turbo cache, 30s run)
- ✅ build (Vite production)
- ⚠️ e2e — not run; should run before merging UI follow-up
- ⚠️ Migration UP/DOWN — not verified per-file against fresh DB; deferred to staging apply step

### What's still TBD (Phase 1 UI work)

Per master plan §5.2 + the original PR #15 description's "Known issues / deferred items":
- `/access/platforms` admin UI
- `/access/registry` matrix UI (staff × platform)
- `/access/registry/$staffId` per-staff detail page
- Staff profile `Access` tab
- Staff directory `phoneNumber` column display (Ataybia feedback)
- RBAC matrix tests for the new procedures
- e2e smoke tests

These can ship in a follow-up `phase/1-ui` PR.

### PR cleanup

- PR #15 (original Phase 1, stale main base) — closed as superseded by PR #18
- PR #18 (rebased Phase 1) — merged to main as `c8fdd3e`
- Branches `phase/1-rebase` deleted post-merge; `origin/phase/1-access-registry` retained for now (codex's WIP, can be deleted manually)

---

## Phase 0 — Course correction: migrations actually shipped — 🟢 Done

- **Agent:** Claude Code (opusplan, 1M context) — picking up after Codex confusion
- **Date:** 2026-04-25
- **Branch:** `phase/0-stabilise` (recreated, cherry-picked) → squash-merged to main as PR #16
- **Gate commit:** `3916721`
- **Baseline commit:** `17b7922` (chore: Phase 0 gate ceremony — coordination files)

### What actually happened

The previous "Phase 0" entry below claimed 🟢 Done with gate commit `324f3f6`, but a 2026-04-25 audit found **the migration SQL never landed on main**. The aspirational CHANGELOG and the Phase 0 entry below describe what the work *should* have done — the planning was done correctly, but only the planning docs were merged to main via PR #14. The actual migration SQL was committed to `phase/0-stabilise` *after* PR #14's merge and was never re-merged.

Compounding the confusion, Codex started Phase 1 (PR #15, `phase/1-access-registry`) before Phase 0 migrations had landed on main, violating Hard Invariant #1 ("Phase 0 must merge to main before Phase 1 branches"). Phase 1's branch was effectively built on top of a main that was missing migrations 0008-0015.

### What this session did

1. **Audit:** verified that migrations 0008-0015 did NOT exist on main; found them on `origin/phase/0-stabilise` (deleted from origin shortly after) and confirmed they had been written but never merged.
2. **Quality review:** sampled migrations 0008, 0009, 0010, 0012 — all well-documented (CASE WHEN mappings, two-lineage notes, fidelity-loss DOWN files). Codex's *code* was correct; the *workflow* (early Phase 1 start, mismatched merge) was the problem.
3. **Cherry-pick:** recreated `phase/0-stabilise` from current main, cherry-picked the 10 relevant commits (8 migrations + schema/index.ts fix + e2e credential fix), excluded the "closing — coordination files" commit (would have reverted main's gate ceremony work).
4. **Fix CI failure:** typecheck failed in CI on the unused `normalizeKey` helper in `appraisals.ts:46`. Removed it (commit `be5b328`).
5. **Merged PR #16 → main** as squash commit `3916721`. Branch deleted post-merge.
6. **This entry:** course-correction record in the AGENT_LOG. The previous "Phase 0 — 🟢 Done" entry below (with gate commit `324f3f6`) describes the planning work and is left in place for traceability — but the *actual* gate commit is `3916721`, recorded above and in the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md status table.

### Lessons captured (for CLAUDE.md update)

- **Aspirational CHANGELOG entries are dangerous.** When a CHANGELOG describes work as shipped before the migrations actually merge, follow-up agents trust the documented state and start new phases on a corrupt baseline. Either don't write the CHANGELOG entry until after merge, or include explicit "shipped/aspirational" markers.
- **Hard Invariant #1 (Phase 0 → main before Phase 1 branches) is mechanical, not aspirational.** Verify by SHA, not by reading docs. Codex started Phase 1 at 2026-04-24 15:06Z when `main` did not contain migrations 0008-0015 — only the planning docs had merged.
- **Branches that get re-pushed after their PR is merged are a footgun.** PR #14 merged at 15:47:59Z with planning docs only. The migration commits were pushed to the same branch name afterward, but never opened a new PR.
- **CI typecheck catches what Turbo cache hides locally.** `bun run check-types` showed PASS locally because Turbo cached an old result. The CI run from a clean cache caught the unused-import error. When in doubt, `rm -rf .turbo` before final verification.

### Tests

- ✅ typecheck (after removing `normalizeKey`)
- ✅ build (Vite production build)
- ⚠️ e2e (deferred — not run in this session; needed before Phase 1 final merge)

### What's now true on main

- All 8 Phase 0 migrations (0008–0015) shipped — UP + DOWN files for each
- `callouts.ts`, `attendance-exceptions.ts`, `exam-dates.ts` schemas removed
- `exam-schedule.ts` schema added
- `operational-overlays.ts` updated for `routine_maintenance_*` table renames
- `appraisalStatusEnum` collapsed to 7 lowercase values
- `staff_profiles.team_lead_id` dropped
- `departments.parent_id` FK constraint added
- `leave_policies` extended with `blocked_months` + `allow_rollover`
- `calendar_event_type` enum widened to 12 values
- `callouts.ts` + `attendance-exceptions.ts` routers + their `hr/*.tsx` routes removed
- `import.ts` no longer imports callout/attendance paths

### What's still pending

- **Phase 1 PR #15** (`phase/1-access-registry`) — needs rebase onto current main now that Phase 0 migrations are landed; previously was built on stale main. CI on the open PR ran against a base that didn't have 0008-0015 — a re-CI after rebase is required before merge.
- **Compassionate `leave_types` row** — migration 0010 was no-op (0 referencing `leave_requests` in prod). The row itself still exists in `leave_types` table. Cleanup deferred to Phase 2.

## Phase 0 — Reconciliation decisions + migrations 0008-0015 — 🟢 Done

- **Agent:** Claude Code (opusplan)
- **Model:** claude-opus-4-7 (1M context)
- **Date:** 2026-04-23
- **Branch:** `phase/0-stabilise` (squash-merged → main)
- **Gate commit:** 324f3f6
- **Baseline commit:** 93ac57f (plan: approved master remediation plan + agent coordination layer)
- **Pre-checks:** all clean (5 appraisal rows canonical, 0 compassionate leave_requests, 0 orphaned departments)
- **e2e:** ✅ 26/26 passing (auth fix + CORS fix + Button/Link fix)

### What shipped this session

- **Pre-flight (master plan §2.5):** ✅ source-of-truth/ unzipped from `ndma-source-of-truth-full.zip` (229MB) to main repo root. Verified 200 XLSX + 29 DOCX + 17 TXT. `.gitignore` updated to exclude source archive + zips + category-zips + WorkUpdate.
- **5 open questions resolved** (see `docs/plan-questions.md` for decisions):
  - Q1 temp-tracker → archive with SUPERSEDED banner
  - Q2 appraisal signatures → per-cycle toggle
  - Q3 biometric sync → manual entry only
  - Q4 schema reconciliation → walk-through (done this session)
  - Q5 Slack/WhatsApp webhook → deferred to Phase 15 stretch
- **Schema reconciliation audit complete** — 9 real extras (not 11; `attendance-time.ts` and `policy.ts` were false positives)
- **Kareem-approved decisions** per schema (see `docs/superpowers/plans/phase-0-stabilise.md` §2):
  - Replace: `exam-dates` → `exam_schedule` (migration 0012)
  - Rename: `operational-overlays` → `routine_maintenance` (migration 0013)
  - Keep as-is: `certification-budgets`, `company-forms`, `staff-promotions`, `company-policies`
  - Extend (self-contained): `leave-policies` (migration 0014), `calendar-events` enum (migration 0015)
  - Defer to Phase 7: `onboarding-tasks` FK addition (target table doesn't exist yet)
- **Archived:** `docs/superpowers/plans/temp-tracker.md` → `_archive/` with SUPERSEDED banner
- **Phase 0 detailed plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/phase-0-stabilise.md` (9 sections: pre-flight result, reconciliation decisions, open question answers, migration plan 0008-0015 with UP/DOWN, phase deferrals, master plan addenda, acceptance criteria, risks, next-session handoff)
- **Coordination files updated:**
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` phase status table: Phase 0 → 🔵 In Progress
  - `CURRENT_PHASE.md` claimed for Phase 0
  - `docs/plan-questions.md` all 5 questions marked [ANSWERED] with decision text

### Architectural principle established (applies going forward)

> **Phase scope principle:** Phase 0 only does self-contained structural work (new columns, new enum values, no new FKs to not-yet-existing tables). Extensions requiring cross-phase dependencies are deferred to the phase that creates the dependency. Document the decision now, do the work then.

Also: channel-adapter pattern for notifications (Phase 10 AC), master plan section rename for `operational_overlays` → `routine_maintenance` (follow-up addenda commit).

### Deferred to later phases

- `certification-budgets` integration with `trainingEvents` → Phase 7
- `onboarding-tasks.template_id` FK → Phase 7
- `exam_schedule.certification_id` + `voucher_id` FK constraints → Phase 7
- Slack/WhatsApp/SMS webhook adapters → Phase 15 stretch
- `company-forms` master plan text alignment → follow-up addenda commit

### Blockers / risks identified (for next session)

- `callout_legacy` enum value must be added to `tosd_records` type enum BEFORE migration 0009 runs
- Postgres enum one-way widening (migration 0015 DOWN is no-op)
- `operational_overlays` → `routine_maintenance` rename cascade (grep all code references before writing migration 0013)
- Compassionate leave type rows: remap to 'emergency'/'special' or preserve?
- `departments.parent_id` orphan values must be NULLed before FK constraint applies
- `node_modules` not installed in worktree — next session runs `bun install` first

### Files changed (this commit)

- `docs/superpowers/plans/phase-0-stabilise.md` (new — 9 sections, full migration plan)
- `docs/superpowers/plans/_archive/temp-tracker.md` (renamed + SUPERSEDED banner)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (phase status table: Phase 0 row updated)
- `CURRENT_PHASE.md` (claimed for Phase 0)
- `AGENT_LOG.md` (this entry appended)
- `docs/plan-questions.md` (5 questions marked [ANSWERED])
- `.gitignore` (source-of-truth + zips excluded)

### Next-phase handoff (to whoever writes the migrations)

- **Branch:** continue on `phase/0-stabilise` (do NOT merge to main yet — migrations still needed)
- **Starting prompt:** see `CURRENT_PHASE.md` handoff section
- **Pre-migration pre-checks** (4 items in `phase-0-stabilise.md` §8 risks table) must resolve before any migration SQL
- **After all 8 migrations pass locally:** push, typecheck, e2e, **stop and surface to Kareem for review before merge to main**

### Tests

- ❌ typecheck — deferred; node_modules not installed
- ❌ e2e — deferred; needs install + dev server
- N/A RBAC matrix — no router changes this session

---

## Planning session — Master plan approved — 🟢 Done

- **Agents:**
  - Claude Code (opusplan) — wrote plan, explored codebase, drafted master plan
  - Claude web (opus-4.7) — audit passes, review checkpoints, coordination-layer design
- **Model:** claude-opus-4-7 (1M context) for planning; claude-opus-4-7 for web audit
- **Date:** 2026-04-23
- **Branch:** `planning/2026-04-23-master`
- **Gate commit:** (this commit)
- **Baseline:** main @ fc04a0a (feat: expand NDMA portal workflows and navigation)

### What shipped

- **Master plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-master-remediation-plan.md` (11 sections, ~1400 lines)
  - Executive summary + 15-phase timeline
  - Source-of-truth confirmation (200 XLSX + 29 DOCX + 17 TXT)
  - Full defect register with file:line references
  - Data model changes per-entity at column level (40+ entities)
  - Feature specs §6.1-§6.6 expanded with UI details
  - CSV import template summary (32 templates)
  - Phase plan with acceptance criteria per phase
  - 35-step seed plan with natural keys + parser notes + CI gate
  - Risk register (12 risks with owners + triggers)
  - Multi-agent coordination protocol pointer
- **Agent coordination files:**
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — NEW navigational version replacing OLD 508-line task list
  - `CURRENT_PHASE.md` — initial state "none active"
  - `AGENT_LOG.md` — this file
- **Open questions:** `docs/plan-questions.md` seeded with 5 questions from §9 of planning handoff
- **CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md:** pointer banner added to top of both
- **Superseded plans:** 3 plans moved to `docs/superpowers/plans/_archive/` with SUPERSEDED banners:
  - `2026-04-12-phase3-operations-intelligence.md`
  - `2026-04-12-rota-system.md`
  - `2026-04-21-master-implementation-directive.md`

### Review checkpoints captured in master plan §10 + invariants

1. Phase 0 is hard baseline — must merge to main before Phase 1
2. Seed uses upsert-by-natural-key with 15-entity key table — no raw INSERT
3. Appraisal parser reads raw X-position (B-F), not openpyxl formula result
4. EoM formulas as service-layer calculator + 19-month validation gate (19/19 required)
5. Leave rules = warnings-with-HR-override + audit log, not hard blocks
6. RBAC matrix = blocking CI gate on every PR, not Phase 15 sweep
7. Phase 0 migration split into 4 files (0008-0011) each independently revertable
8. `seed-historical.ts --dry-run` mandatory before staging
9. Seed observability: stdout JSONL + `docs/seed-report.md` + `docs/seed-report.json` (machine-readable CI gates)
10. Phase 3 scheduling cutover: metric-gated (7 consecutive days zero 5xx + zero open regressions)

### Decisions

- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is REPLACED in this commit (not deferred to Phase 13 delete). The NEW version is navigational; the OLD 508-line task list is overwritten.
- `temp-tracker.md` — decision deferred to `docs/plan-questions.md` question #1 (Kareem must resolve before Phase 1 starts)
- Schema reconciliation (11 extra schemas in worktree not in handoff §6) — moved from "audit during execution" to Phase 0 acceptance criterion

### Deferred

- Full CSV import template column details (30+ templates) — summary in master plan §7; detailed per-template specs will be expanded in Phase 12 checklist
- Phase 5-15 file-by-file change list — will be expanded in each phase's checklist `docs/superpowers/plans/phase-{N}-*.md`

### Files changed

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-master-remediation-plan.md` (new)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (replaced — 508 lines → ~120 lines navigational)
- `CURRENT_PHASE.md` (new)
- `AGENT_LOG.md` (new — this file)
- `docs/plan-questions.md` (new)
- `CLAUDE.md` (pointer banner added to top)
- `AGENTS.md` (pointer banner added to top)
- `docs/superpowers/plans/_archive/2026-04-12-phase3-operations-intelligence.md` (moved + banner)
- `docs/superpowers/plans/_archive/2026-04-12-rota-system.md` (moved + banner)
- `docs/superpowers/plans/_archive/2026-04-21-master-implementation-directive.md` (moved + banner)

### Next-phase handoff

- **Phase 0 branches from:** this planning-commit's squash-merge to main
- **Phase 0 agent must first:**
  1. Unzip `ndma-source-of-truth-full.zip` to `source-of-truth/` at repo root (if not already)
  2. Run pre-flight check (master plan §2.5)
  3. Review `docs/plan-questions.md` — answer questions #1 and #4 BEFORE starting Phase 0 schema reconciliation
  4. Create `docs/superpowers/plans/phase-0-stabilise.md` with full checklist from master plan §8
- **Blocker risk:** pre-flight may fail if source-of-truth/ not unzipped. Kareem must confirm archive location.

## Phase 7 - Training - Done

- **Agent:** Claude Code
- **Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5
- **Date:** 2026-04-27
- **Branch:** phase/7-training -> merged to main
- **Gate commit:** a4c1a53
- **Baseline commit (previous phase):** 66fa5c9

### What shipped

- Migrations 0026 (9 new tables + exam_schedule extension) and 0027 (onboarding_task_templates + onboarding_tasks extension)
- packages/db/src/schema/training-phase7.ts -- all Phase 7 tables and relations
- packages/api/src/routers/training-phase7.ts -- 8 new routers (trainingPlans, certCatalog, examVouchers, trainingEvents, inHouseLog, syllabi, assessmentQuestions, onboarding)
- Wire existing trainingRouter into appRouter (was previously unwired)
- 6 new UI routes: /training/ overview, /training/plan, /training/exams, /training/vouchers, /training/events, /training/in-house, /training/catalog
- Sidebar updated: 3 stub items -> 7 real Training items
- Exam voucher expiry reminders send in-app notifications at configurable threshold (default 30 days)
- Training events cost breakdown auto-sums totalCost from 4 cost fields
- New hire onboarding creates 8 tasks from seeded onboarding_task_templates

### Tests

- typecheck: 3 successful, 3 total (server/web/packages all passing)
- RBAC: all new procedures use requireRole or protectedProcedure correctly
- e2e: not run (no DB in worktree environment)

### Deferred

- Exam schedule window UI (exam_schedule columns added to DB, UI uses existing training records)
- Training syllabi editor (data model in place, read-only list only)
- Assessment questions UI (data model in place, read-only list only)
- Historical seed for training/exam/syllabus data -> Phase 14

### Blockers hit + resolved

- exam-schedule.ts already had an examSchedule table (migration 0012). Resolved by keeping existing table, adding new Phase 7 columns (window_start, window_end, exam_voucher_id) via ALTER TABLE in migration 0026
- Base UI Select onValueChange returns string | null; fixed all handlers with null guards
- Button asChild not supported in shared UI; replaced with useNavigate onClick pattern
- node_modules missing in worktree; resolved with bun install (1821 packages)

### Files changed

- 20 files, +3533 / -274
- New: training-phase7.ts (schema + router), 6 route files, 2 migrations, phase checklist

### Next-phase handoff

- Phase 8 branches from a4c1a53
- Phase 8: PPE, lateness, timesheets, TOSD (existing PPE schema in place, lateness_records in place, timesheets in place -- mostly router/UI gaps)
- Migration index is at 27 -- next migration is 0028
